Very fast full-color VGA driver esp32s3 (R16N8) for Arduino. Needed arduino-esp32 version 3.1.0-RC1 and above.
(https://espressif.github.io/arduino-esp32/package_esp32_dev_index.json)
Used bounce-buffer and fast gdma access on PSRAM for double screen-buffers.
Resolution 640x480 only. Limitation pixelclock and speed psram.
The library has builtin functions for base graphics and prints.
